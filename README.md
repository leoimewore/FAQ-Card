This is a Front End Mentor Project and I use Event listener DOM functions to design an FAQ drop down design

Methodology

Started off with HTML and CSS. I have to use CSS positioning to move images outside the normal flow of the HTML document and i also implement CSS grid and Flex Box to make the layout structured and also simple CSS Transforms.
Also introduce JS classes for to toggle for the 5 drop downs

JavaScript Approach

My approach was to declare all the DOM elements critical to this design at the start of the js script- inputs and buttons.

Then i develop functions to check classes on my style sheet and implement when conditions where met by the UI users.

Finally added an conditional statement to show an alert if all input boxes meet the criteria.

Lessons learned

Learning about more DOM manipulation items and also improving on my CSS positioning. Initially had difficulty position items out of normal document flow, but I am able to go through this with research.
